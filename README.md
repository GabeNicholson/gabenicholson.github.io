### 1. Predicting Covid-19 News Sentiment with Fine-Tuned RoBERTa

- Has over 93% accuracy on test set (Over 20% more accurate than BERT).
- Used to predict over 500,000 Covid-19 related articles.
- Currently being used at the University of Chicago and Dartmouth College (Professor Bruce Sacerdote and his lab).
- Found that the news is overly negative and that the news publishes much more often when bad things happen compared to when good things occur. For example, when the Omicron wave was decreasing, the news was publishing 6x less articles compared to the week before when it was at its peak. Further, the average news sentiment during the decrease in cases was still more negative than positive.
